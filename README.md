## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

- I first planned out how I would go about structuring the card.

- Broke down each component into smaller segments as to have an easier approach to the problem.

- Once my plan was laid out using Figma, I proceeded to write out the basic structure with HTML and
  styled it using CSS along the way.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Gained a better grasp at how flexbox can be utilized in a desktop screen view and a mobile view.

- Gathered more experience with HTML and CSS structure.

- Had a chance to use Figma, a design tool, to assist me in recreating this card template.

### Continued development

- I would like to review other others solutions to this challenge and see how I can improve my own work.

- Then follow up again with this challenge and update any mistakes or bad practices made along the way.
